## create an empty list
### Open the file
	### read through each line
	### Add each site to the list

### turn the list into a set -- will shorten it ton only the unique numbers

## create a for loop
## for each item in the set - 
	## create an output file with the name of the item in the set
	## open the input file
	## read through each line 
		# ask if the site name matches the item in the list
		# if it does print the line to the file
	#close the input file
	#close the output file
