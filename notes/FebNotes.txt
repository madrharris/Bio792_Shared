Into to programming


CV --> include github repo link

Start thinking about project. Organizing data from genemapper?
writeup, presentation, and 

find download for practical computing for biologists (ch 7)

"pseudocode" <-- write out code in english first. line that does a for-loop. Starts here, this is how it ends
	write a story
	
* series of small tasks
* can be written in any language
* 

Compiled vs interpretive languages
Compiled: C, C+, java
	translated from human readable code (source code) to computer understandable instructions
	only compiled once
Interpretive: perl, python, ruby, R, Matlab (scripting language)
	processed by an interpreter each time they run, Interpreter is a compiled program
	needs to be interp every time its run
	program itself is source code, easy to modify, can be run on any machine
	BASH is our interpreter for shell scripts
	
	
Basics:
arguments; values sent to program when run
code
	noun: program/line of program
	
execute: begin and carry out
function: subprogram called repeatedly to perform same task
parameters; values sent to a function when called
parse: extract particular data elements from larger block of text
statement: line of program which can assign a value, do comparison, or perform other ops

How to write a program
- what do
- what variables
- how move through
- what want from end

- write pseudocode first

Building blocks

- variables
	name with a  value. #, character, list
	name --> $filename $filelist, no $ in python
		type --> kind of info
		value --> actual piece of info
		
		types:
			integer
			floating point: number with non zero after decimal
			boolean: two values. True or false
			string: sequence of text. "This is a string"
			
		Container: arrays and lists
			array: collection of data under one variable name
				one dimensional array is called a list or vector
					fruit = ['apple', 'pear', '6', '13.5']
				each item can be referred to as its position in list. First element is 0.
		Dictionary
			associative array, hash or map
			container with more than one variable
			collection of names or keys and associated values	
				eq: phone book. Names & Numbers. keep together
				
	variables in action
		mathematical operations: * + /
			var1 + var2	
				both integers -> get sum
				both strings -> combine them
				
				
				
- flow control --> how interact
	loops
		for loop: cycles through each item of a predefined collection
		while loop: without a predetermined list: just until a condition is met
- list and dictionaries

- input & output


HW: part 3 python programming.
answer in jupyter notebook, turn it in as a jupyter notebook
